# ParlayANN

ParlayANN is a library of approximate nearest neighbor search algorithms, along with a set of useful tools for designing such algorithms. It is written in C++ and uses parallel primitives from [ParlayLib](https://cmuparlay.github.io/parlaylib/). Currently it includes implementations of the ANNS algorithms [DiskANN](https://github.com/microsoft/DiskANN), [HNSW](https://github.com/nmslib/hnswlib), [HCNNG](https://github.com/jalvarm/hcnng), and [pyNNDescent](https://pynndescent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

To install, [clone the repo](https://github.com/cmuparlay/ParlayANN/tree/main) and then initiate the ParlayLib submodule:

```bash
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
